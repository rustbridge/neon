//! Provides temporary access to JavaScript typed arrays.
//!
//! ## Typed Arrays
//!
//! JavaScript's [typed arrays][typed-arrays] are objects that allow reading and writing
//! raw binary data in memory.
//!
//! Typed arrays are managed with the [`ArrayBuffer`][ArrayBuffer] type, which controls
//! the storage of the underlying data buffer, and several typed views for managing access
//! to the buffer. Neon provides access to the `ArrayBuffer` class with the
//! [`JsArrayBuffer`](crate::types::JsArrayBuffer) type.
//!
//! Node also provides a [`Buffer`][Buffer] type, which is built on top of `ArrayBuffer`
//! and provides additional functionality. Neon provides access to the `Buffer` class
//! with the [`JsBuffer`](crate::types::JsBuffer) type.
//!
//! Many of Node's I/O APIs work with these types, and they can also be used for
//! compact in-memory data structures, which can be shared efficiently between
//! JavaScript and Rust without copying.
//!
//! ## Borrowing
//!
//! Neon makes it possible to [borrow][borrow] temporary access to the internal memory
//! of a typed array by pausing execution of JavaScript with a
//! [`Lock`](crate::context::Lock) and returning a reference to a
//! [`BinaryData`](crate::types::BinaryData) struct. The [`Borrow`](Borrow) and
//! [`BorrowMut`](BorrowMut) traits provide the methods for borrowing this typed array data.
